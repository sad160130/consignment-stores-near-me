            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4 mt-8">Our Story</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              Consignment Stores Near Me was founded with a simple vision: to make it easier for 
              people to find and support local consignment stores in their communities. We recognized 
              that while consignment shopping has grown tremendously in popularity, there wasn&apos;t a 
              centralized resource where people could easily discover stores in their area.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              Starting with extensive research and partnerships with consignment store owners across 
              the country, we&apos;ve built a comprehensive database that now includes over {totalStores.toLocaleString()} 
              stores across {totalStates} states and {totalCities} cities nationwide.
            </p>
